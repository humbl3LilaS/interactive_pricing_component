- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - UI Library
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned
- Creating reactive component base on user action
- Bind the action on top of already built UI component not worrying about underlying style of the component
- Utilization of UI framework for more smooth and fast workflow and awesome DX

### Continued development

- I'll start learning and building react app using state management library
- Study more about UI library and underlying concept
